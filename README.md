## VERY IMPORTANT Disclaimer

This project has been created using public, crowd-sourced food data. I make not claims it is accurate, and it **should not be used** as definitive guide of nut-free or allergen free food.

Food ingredients constantly change. Something that was allergen free yesterday may not be tomorrow. Allergies reactions can be serious, thus they should not be treated lightly. **Always check the labels, even in products you consume regularly**

If you find any obvious mistakes/inaccuracies, please [let me know](https://github.com/carlosyanez/nutfree/issues).
In  case you find missing /incorrect ingredientes, please update the item directly on [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org).
